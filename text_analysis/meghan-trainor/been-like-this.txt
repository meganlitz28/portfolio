Boom-boom
ooh-wee, she got that booty
That type of boom-boom, that bass that I like
I said, "Who, me?" I keep it juicy
So better hold on, hold on for dear life
Oh, 'cause she's cute and she's classy
Thick, bold and sassy
She knows what she do when she moves (when she moves)
I know it's hard to imagine
But why you keep asking like all this came out of the blue
But I been like this, I been like this
Run your mouth, but I'm on your lips
Ain't nothin' new, still that bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
I been like this, I been like this
Take your shots while I blow a kiss
Ain't nothin' new, still that bitch
'Cause I been like, been like - (boom-boom)
Baby, I would do the (ooh), shake a little (ooh), make it jiggle (ooh)
Put that thing in the middle for Meghan and Pizzle (ooh-ooh)
'Cause you're doin' it just the way I like
And you can't fool me
I know exactly what you wanna do to me
And baby, you're just gonna make me act up on this flight
We gon' ride first class to heaven
Your hands all over this legend
Don't stress, baby, that's just the way that I move (do)
Trippin' over these Grammys, but who needs a stand
When their reservation got levitation for two?
We're goin' up
'Cause I been like this (this), I been like this (this)
You talk that smack, but I'm on your lips
I got money to the ceiling 'cause I'm filthy rich
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
Said, I been like this (this), I been like this (this)
You talk that smack (woo), but I'm on your lips
It ain't nothin' new, just me and my bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like (this)
I'm a pop star, I'm a wifey
Put an X by my name if you don't like me (oh)
Not a thing you do excites me
I'ma have to get a little bit spicy
Oh, you do the most
Oh, darling, you must be obsessed with me
You like me, like me, like me (oh)
But I been like this (this), I been like this (this)
You talk that smack, but I'm on your lips (woo-ooh)
It ain't nothin' new, still that bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
I said I been like this, I been like this
Talk that smack, but I'm on your lips
It ain't nothin' new, just me and my bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
Ooh, ooh-ooh (boom-boom)
It ain't nothin' new, just me and my bitch
'Cause I been like, been like, been like this
