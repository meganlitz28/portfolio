It's the real difference between an adult and a child
Bum, bum-bum
Bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Whoops, you messed up (bum, bum-bum)
Ran around and then you got caught (bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum)
Whoops, you messed up (bum, bum-bum)
Now you're cryin' about what you lost (bum, bum-bum-bum-bum-bum)
(Ooh-ooh) you did me dirty
(Ah-ah) hope she was worth it
(Ooh-ooh) you say you're sorry
But I think what you really mean is
Whoops
We had a good thing
With cute-ass nicknames
Guess our forever (mm-mm)
Turned into never
And she got 'bout half
Of my looks with no class
Now you say, "Come back"
But I think what you really mean is
Whoops, you messed up (messed up)
Ran around and then you got caught
Whoops, you messed up (messed up)
Now you're cryin' about what you lost
(Ooh-ooh) you did me dirty
(Ah-ah) hope she was worth it
(Ooh-ooh) you say you're sorry
(Ah-ah) but I think what you really mean is
Whoops, get gone
Pack it up, babe, we done
I said whoops, get gone
That's enough, baby, we done
I said
Pictures on your phone
That's called an uh-oh
Thought you were sneaky (mm-mm)
But you made it easy
And she got 'bout half
Of my looks with no ass
Now you say, "Come back"
But I think what you really mean is
Whoops (whoops), you messed up (you messed up)
Ran around and then you got caught
Whoops (whoops), you messed up (messed up)
Now you're cryin' about what you lost
(Ooh-ooh) you did me dirty (you did me dirty, babe)
(Ah-ah) hope she was worth it (yeah)
(Ooh-ooh) you say you're sorry
(Ah-ah) but I think what you really mean is
W-H-O-O-P-S (ah-ah)
Night, night, bitch, you made your bed (ah-ah)
That's the dumbest shit you ever did
Ever did, ever did (eh-eh-eh)
Whoops (whoops), you messed up (messed up)
Ran around and then you got caught
Whoops (whoops), you messed up (messed up, babe)
Now you're cryin' about what you lost
(Ooh-ooh) you did me dirty (you did me dirty, babe)
(Ah-ah) hope she was worth it (yeah-yeah)
(Ooh-ooh) you say you're sorry
(Ah-ah) but I think what you really mean is
Whoops (hey), get gone
Pack it up, babe, we done (we done)
I said whoops, get gone
That's enough, baby, we done
I said whoops, get gone
Pack it up, babe, we done
I said whoops, get gone (ey, ey)
That's enough, baby, we done
I say whoops
