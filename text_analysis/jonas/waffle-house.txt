We never knew how to forfeit (hey now)
But we always knew how to talk sh- (hey now)

Oh, deep conversations at the Waffle House
Headstrong father and a determined mother
Oh, that's why some nights we tried to kill each other
But you know it's always love (hey now)
We never knew how to fake it (hey now)
But we always knew how to break sh- (hey now)
