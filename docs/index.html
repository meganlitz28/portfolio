        <h2>About Me</h2>       
       
        <p>My name is Megan Litz and Iâ€™m a DIGIT major. I have lived in Erie PA for most of my life. In my free time, I enjoy reading and enjoy photography. My favorite hobbies are competitive Go-Karting and photography. I graduated from McDowell High School. I also earned a certificate from Erie County Technical School for Graphic Design and Media. I plan to pursue being a web designer after I graduate from Behrend.</p>
