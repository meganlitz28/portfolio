        <p> The most significant challenge for new learners at first is learning how to use HTML properly and making sure it is green. When I started making my websites, the main challenge on my GitHub site was the placement of the photos and the placement of the layout. With my site on WordPress, my challenge was the placement and theme of it. With the GitHub site, I had the advantage of having more control over what I do and where I place them on my site. The hardest part of both the GitHub site and the WordPress site is trying to have their layout in the same way as each other and have the same information on them. However I had made the sites slightly different, but they can be close to being the same as each other. Another challenge that I have is trying to keep the photos a good size and to also flex them, so they go smaller. I believe that I need to improve on the photo layout of my GitHub site. I will still need to work on making flex containers work the way I want. However, it is still a work in progress to get it to work the way I would like. When I continue working on my websites, the main site that I will probably continue will be my GitHub site. This is because I get more control, and I can design the site the way I want to.
