        <h2>Game Analysis</h2> 
        
        <div> 
            Inner Life is the game I chose for the game analysis. The game's concept is to help the Titan fix parts of itself and find others like him. It is set in a desert and mostly played inside the character, Titan.  The biggest problem with the game is that there is no save feature, I was never able to finish the game because of this. I had to start at the beginning every time I started playing again. I have not been able to see as much of the game as I wanted to, I attempted to play it over twenty times. I would remember what I did last and then try to get further with each attempt, but due to the lack of save issue, I just could never finish it.
            The commentary in the game is not the best. I believe that they should put a backstory to explain what happened to everyone. I wish I knew what the reason was for no one there. 
            When playing Inner Life, you are introduced to the Dr and the titan in the game. When you first start you have to follow the pipelines to three different spots and you have to hit the “E” button at three different spots. The Dr started talking to the titan and within the conversation between them, you could choose some of your choices. Then as you continue on you get put into the Titan and you have to perform the code challenge to stop the water. 
            The main character is called Dr., who at the beginning is sick of some sort, he is a traveler and he is trying to find other Titans, he is a healer and he is trying to heal the Titans who are suffering. With the characters in the game, the Dr is the main character and the only character that you have control over. However, the characters Connie(Leader of Heater Room of the Heart), Piper(Distribution Center), Titan, and Woody(worker of the legs). They are characters that you can only talk to and do tasks for. The characters that are listed are all a part of how the Titan works. When the Dr stopped Connie and Piper, he was able to get the titan heat back to normal.
            The details and graphics are amazing. The details go all the way down to the smallest details. For example, the puddle of tears has so many details.  The artist probably hand-drawn and used graphics to do the movements of the game.
            The challenges that are in the game are a main part of the story. One of the tasks that the Dr has to do is restore the balance and stop the titan from crying. You also have to help Connie and Piper stop arguing and help Woody get his leg unstuck from the machine. One of the challenges is that you have to find the code to turn off the water and then find the place to put the code into. 
            The challenges of the game are supposed to make the Titan better. After each one, the titan opens up and talks about his problems. However, to learn more you have to do more challenges to learn more about him 
            Even though I have not finished the game all the way through yet, I believe that the horizon of the game will be the Dr and the Titan finding the Titans and why they are gone. 
            In order to complete the tasks, you also have to find objects to help you complete the task at hand. Most of the objects are scattered around the map. Some of the objects that are in the game are fish, a bottle, rings, a book, etc. Any items that are in the area you are in can be used for the tasks. However, some tasks are multi-step and require finding one item before the next one.
